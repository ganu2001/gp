Most of the crop plants prefer nitrogen in nitrate form; but paddy and few other higher plants prefer nitrogen in ammonical form. Ammonical form of nitrogen is however, easily covertible into nitrate form. Most of the fertilizers contain nitrogen in these two available forms. Urea, however, contains nitrogen in amide form but this form of nitrogen is swiftly converted by soil micro-organisms into ammonical form and then into nitrate form. Based on the forms of nitrogen they contain, nitrogenous fertilizers are classified into following four categories, viz. (1) nitrate fertilizers, (2) ammonical fertilizers, (3) ammonical-nitrate fertilizers, and (4) amide fertilizers.</H3></P>
