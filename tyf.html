<h1> TYPES OF FERTILIZERS </h1>
<h2><b>1 : AMINO ACID </b></h2>
<p><i><h4>Autotrophic microalgae are a promising fbioproducts platform.<br>
 However, the fundamental requirements these organisms have for<br>
 nitrogen fertilizer severely limit the impact and scale of their<br>
 cultivation. As an alternative to inorganic fertilizers,<br>
 we investigated the possibility of using amino acids from <br>
deconstructed biomass as a nitrogen source in the genus Dunaliella.<br>
 We found that only four amino acids...for  <a href="amino.html">more information....</a></h4></i></p>
<h2><b>2 : UREA </b></h2>
<P><i><h4>Urea serves an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing<br>
 compounds by animals and is the main nitrogen-containing substance in the urine of mammals.<br>
 It is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non-toxic.<br>
 Dissolved in water, it is neither acidic nor alkaline.for<a href="urea.html"> more information....</a></i></h4></p> 
<h2><b>3:AMMONIUM SULPHATE </b></h2>
<p><i><h4>Ammonium sulfate solutions are a pertinent industrial by-product.<br> 
In its state-of-the-art plants thyssenkrupp has developed a process to convert ammonium sulfate<br>
 solution to granules. The key advantages over liquid and crystalline solutions are improved<br>
 spreading and mixing properties.for<a href="ammonium.html"> more information....</a></h4></i></p>
